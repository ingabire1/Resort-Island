        <p>my website is about the Oceanic Islands are formed by eruptions of volcanoes on the ocean floor. As the volcanoes erupt, they build up layers of lava that may eventually break the water's surface. When the tops of the volcanoes appear above the water, they form islands such as those of Hawaii.
            The oceanic island of Kauai, Hawaii, was built up from the seafloor by volcanic eruptions.  </h1>
